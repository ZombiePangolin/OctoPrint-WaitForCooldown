# Wait For Cooldown
Watches G-code for an @WAITFORCOOLDOWN, then waits until hotend temperature is cooled off to the set temperature before continuing.

I created this as alternative to using M109 R60.

## Setup
Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager) or manually from GitHub:
